# AaronRobertsonComposer
Aaron's business website

okay, crazy processs but it's what I've got for now
- pull site off dropbox to include aaron's changes.
- send to github for version control
- paste files here: /Users/diane/work/1_current/DYID/Aaron Composer Site
- copy files into a folder with date on it just in case
- edit files from here in Sublime text; probably need to convert files to .html
- test PHP files here /Applications/XAMPP/xamppfiles/htdocs/AaronRobertsonComposer
